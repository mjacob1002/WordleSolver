# WordleSolver
## Checklist
- [x] Implement the filter to narrow the wordbank
- [x]
- [x] Implement a functional solver, using a naive random guess
- [x] Implement a simulation to test average amount of guesses to get the correct answer
- [ ] Implement a smarter guessing algorithm (info theory???) to get under 4 guesses
-   [ ] Currently average guess is about 7?! Figure out what is wrong.

## How to Use
When you start the program, you must input the result of the guess the bot said so that the bot can make another guess.

Green Tiles = the letter that is green
Yellow Tiles = "-"
Gray tiles = "_"

Above is the key when interacting with the bot through stdin.
